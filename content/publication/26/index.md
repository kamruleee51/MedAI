abstract: "Now a days in power generation, renewable energy plays a vital role in which photovoltaic energy generation placed top in the list of the renewable energy because of the easy process of generation. The photovoltaic energy depends on the solar irradiance and the temperature. To get the maximum power from the PV panel, the idea of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is arrived. Too many algorithms and controllers have been considered in the past to track the maximum power and to reduce the tracking time and also to improve the efficiency of PV panel. In this paper, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques is proposed to track the maximum power. The proposed method has been evaluated by simulation in MATLAB environment. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique and its ability to track the maximum power of the PV panel."
