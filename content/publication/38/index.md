abstract: "A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) provides a new communication channel between human brain and the computer. This paper presents a direct noninvasive brain-computer interface (BCI) that can help users to select any command in the graphical user interface (GUI) such as appliance control, cursor control, typing, making phone call, etc. The system is based on the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) which use three fixed positioned electrodes for reducing user variation on system performance. The frequency-coded SSVEP is used with different stimuli procedure such as effect of color and angular position of the screen which make the system user independent. The average transfer rate over all subjects is found up to 66.81 bits/min. The attractive features of the system are noninvasive signal recording, little training required for user, higher information transfer rate (HITR) and higher accuracy in living environments."
