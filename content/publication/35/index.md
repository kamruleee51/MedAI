abstract: "Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is used for Brain-Computer Interface that requires little training for user, offers high information transfer rate and higher accuracy in living environments. To elicit an SSVEP, a Repetitive Visual Stimulus (RVS) of rectangular shape has been proposed to the subjects in different ways. RVS is rendered on a computer screen by flashing graphical patterns. The properties of SSVEP depend on the rendering device and frequency, size, shape and color of the stimuli. But, literatures on SSVEP-based BCI are seldom provided with reasons for usefulness of rendering devices or RVS properties. The aim of this research is to study the effect of all these stimulation properties on performance of SSVEP while elicited by a rectangular shape. A correlation matrix is made to help selection of any suitable SSVEP stimulator. The percentage change in energy and power from one kind of stimulation to another is also shown in this paper. Performance achieved in different cases has been compared with each other for apposite understanding. This will help a researcher to select proper stimulation types to elicit SSVEP."
