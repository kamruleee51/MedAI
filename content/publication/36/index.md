abstract: " In this work the electrical activity in brain or known as electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is being analyzed to
study the various effects of sound on the human brain activity. The effect is in the form of variation in either frequency or in
the power of different EEG bands. A biological EEG signal stimulated by Music listening reflects the state of mind, impacts
the analytical brain and the subjective-artistic brain. A two channel EEG acquisition unit is being used to extract brain signal
with high transfer rate as well as good SNR. This paper focused on three types of brain waves which are theta (4-7 Hz), alpha
(8-12 Hz) and beta wave (13-30 Hz). The analysis is carried out using Power Spectral density (PSD), Correlation co-efficient
analysis. The outcome of this research depicted that high amplitude Alpha and low amplitude Beta wave and low amplitude
Alpha and high amplitude Beta wave is associated with melody and rock music respectively meanwhile theta has no effect.
High power of alpha waves and low power of beta waves that obtained during low levels of sound (Melody) indicate that
subjects were in relaxed state. When subjects exposed to high level of sound (Rock), beta waves power increased indicating
subjects in disturbed state. Meanwhile, the decrease of alpha wave magnitude showed that subjects in tense. Thus the subjectâ€™s
executional attention level is determined by analyzing the different components of EEG signal."
