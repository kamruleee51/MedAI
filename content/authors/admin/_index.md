Md Kamrul Hasan is a **PhD candidate** in the [Bioengineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/bioengineering/) department at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where he explores the deployment of AI agents like Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in the field of medical image computing. 
He is an Assistant Professor (on Leave) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering ([EEE](https://www.kuet.ac.bd/department/EEE/)) at Khulna University of Engineering & Technology ([KUET](https://kuet.ac.bd/)). 
Mr. Hasan's research interest primarily concentrates on *developing automated AI-based systems for medical appliances.*


Mr. Hasan graduated from KUET in 2014 with a BSc in engineering in EEE, with a summa-cum-laude CGPA of 3.93 (out of 4.00) and taking first place out of 115 classmates. 
He graduated with a summa-cum-laude CGPA of 4.00 (out of 4.00) in 2017 after finishing his MSc engineering in EEE at KUET. 
Another MSc degree in [Medical Imaging and Applications (MAIA)](https://maiamaster.udg.edu/) was earned by Mr. Hasan in 2019 through the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree program from the [University of Burgundy](https://www.u-bourgogne.fr/) in France, [University of Cassino and Southern Lazio](http://www.eng.unicas.it/) in Italy, and [University of Girona](https://www.udg.edu/ca/) in Spain, obtaining a mark of 8.48 out of 10.0. 


During his MAIA thesis at the [EnCoV](http://igt.ip.uca.fr/encov/) research team (Clermont-Ferrand, France), Mr. Hasan studied laparoscopic imaging and AI under the supervision of [Professor Dr. Adrien Bartoli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_KUZlKYAAAAJ&hl=en). 
The thesis presented an [ART-Net](https://github.com/kamruleee51/ART-Net) to recognize, segment, and extract geometric features for 3D tool pose estimation of a surgical tool. 
The segmented masks were employed for [tool-aware AR](https://youtu.be/Knp4JIhH3Yo) in minimally invasive laparoscopy, increasing its depth perception. 
The 3D tool posture was deployed for 3D measurement and overlaying the pre-operative 3D model onto the real-time laparoscopic image for computer-assisted laparoscopy.
Later, the thesis was published in the Journal of [Medical Image Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/medical-image-analysis) (Elsevier) in 2021 ([Article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2021.101994)).
