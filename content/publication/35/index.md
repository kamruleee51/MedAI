abstract: "The motive of this paper is to design a low cost wireless EEG acquisition system for easily monitoring of the patient. Using local effort and low price employment, this system can be built which includes data acquisition, data transmission, and receiving unit which contains the patient monitoring site. The developed wireless EEG system is also suitable for the applications such as remote control of devices, rescue, etc. Realtime decoding and mobile EEG signal processing with high information transfer rate (ITR) are incorporated in the system. The specialty of the proposed research is inclusion of forth order Butterworth low pass filter which has better stability and sharper cut off with reasonable cost. Using this techniques hardware implementation is possible and GSM system can be added with hardware for long distance wireless transmission of EEG signal. The system performance is simulated by some simulation software. The proposed system is reliable, and cost is about 950 BDT or 12 USD which is reasonable."
