abstract: "The Bangla language is the seventh most spoken language, with 265 million native and
non-native speakers worldwide. However, English is the predominant language for online resources and
technical knowledge, journals, and documentation. Consequently, many Bangla-speaking people, who have
limited command of English, face hurdles to utilize English resources. To bridge the gap between limited
support and increasing demand, researchers conducted many experiments and developed valuable tools and
techniques to create and process Bangla language materials. Many efforts are also ongoing to make it easy
to use the Bangla language in the online and technical domains. There are some review papers to understand
the past, previous, and future Bangla Natural Language Processing (BNLP) trends. The studies are mainly
concentrated on the specific domains of BNLP, such as sentiment analysis, speech recognition, optical
character recognition, and text summarization. There is an apparent scarcity of resources that contain a
comprehensive review of the recent BNLP tools and methods. Therefore, in this paper, we present a thorough
analysis of 75 BNLP research papers and categorize them into 11 categories, namely Information Extraction,
Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition, Parsing, Parts of Speech Tagging, Question Answering
System, Sentiment Analysis, Spam and Fake Detection, Text Summarization, Word Sense Disambiguation,
and Speech Processing and Recognition. We study articles published between 1999 to 2021, and 50% of the
papers were published after 2015. Furthermore, we discuss Classical, Machine Learning and Deep Learning
approaches with different datasets while addressing the limitations and current and future trends of the BNLP."
