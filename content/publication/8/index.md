abstract: "Recently, electroencephalogram-based emotion recognition has become crucial in enabling the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) 
system to become more intelligent. Due to the outstanding applications of emotion recognition, e.g., person-based decision making, 
mind-machine interfacing, cognitive interaction, affect detection, feeling detection, etc., emotion recognition has become successful 
in attracting the recent hype of AI-empowered research. Therefore, numerous studies have been conducted driven by a range of approaches, 
which demand a systematic review of methodologies used for this task with their feature sets and techniques. 
It will facilitate the beginners as guidance towards composing an effective emotion recognition system. 
In this article, we have conducted a rigorous review on the state-of-the-art emotion recognition systems, 
published in recent literature, and summarized some of the common emotion recognition steps with relevant definitions, 
theories, and analyses to provide key knowledge to develop a proper framework. Moreover, studies included here were 
dichotomized based on two categories: i) deep learning-based, and ii) shallow machine learning-based emotion recognition systems. 
The reviewed systems were compared based on methods, classifier, the number of classified emotions, accuracy, and dataset used. 
An informative comparison, recent research trends, and some recommendations are also provided for future research directions."
